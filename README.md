# Magic Gamma Telescope Data Classification

This project aims to classify gamma and hadron particles from the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset. We explore the data, preprocess it, and then build and evaluate several classification models to determine the most effective one for this task.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can find the dataset [here] https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

You can install these libraries by running the following command:
